Corner Notes:

For Location Variable
- there will be 4 front-side and 4 back-side pieces
- Each side will have the following:
    (1,4,2): top right - 1
    (2,3,1): top left - 2
    (3,2,4): bottom left - 3
    (4,1,3): bottom right - 4
For Orientation Variable
- it will be represented by an integer
    0: White/yellow side is on correct face or opposite face
    1: Piece must be rotated CW to get to 0 orientation
    -1: Piece must be rotated CCW to get to 0 orientation
- at (0), 1
    location 1 is (0)
    location 2 is CW(1)
    location 3 is (0)
    location 4 is CW(1)
- at (1), 1
    location 1 is (1)
    location 2 is (-1)
    location 3 is (1)
    location 4 is (-1)
- at (-1), 1
    location 1 is (-1)
    location 2 is (0)
    location 3 is (-1)
    location 4 is (0)
- at (0), 2
    location 1 is (-1)
    location 2 is (0)
    location 3 is (-1)
    location 4 is (0)
- at (1), 2
    location 1 is (0)
    location 2 is CW(1)
    location 3 is (0)
    location 4 is CW(1)

For Color Variable
- it will be a final array of size 3 of characters
- represents colors of the corner

For future versions:
- have yellow/white color of edge always in the same position in the Edge colors array
Cube solver improvements:
Cross:
- When edge is in middle layer and matched with correct color
	Current: brings up to top layer then rematches edge with correct center
	Ideal: just solve in one move as is intuitive
F2L:
- When pair is already split insertable
    Current: first connects pair and separates pair again into split insert form
    Ideal: identify automatic split insert
